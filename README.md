# Scheme (Lisp) - Project Implementations
This repository includes implementations for Koc University's COMP200 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) class projects.

These projects are originally from [MIT's 6.001 SICP course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/).

All of the implementations are written in Scheme(Lisp) language.
